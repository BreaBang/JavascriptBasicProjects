# Basic JavaScript Counter 
I created this basic counter via the FreeCodeAcademy and John Smilga tutorial found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-create-an-image-slider

# Why this Project?
I wanted to practice the following JavaScript concepts:
document.querySelectorAll()
forEach()
addEventListener()
currentTarget property
classList
textContent

# How My Project Differs From the Tutorial
The JavaScript for the project is the same but I added a rose gif and changed some of the CSS. 

# Challenges
After completing the tutorial, my decrease button did not work. I thought it was something wrong with my JS but after checking each line of code I realized it must be something else. I checked my HTML and realized I had a spelling mistake. I have dislexia and sometimes when I am typing in a hurry to keep up, I make mistakes.
