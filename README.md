# JavaScript Basic Projects
This a collection of basic JavaScript projects I worked on to better understand JavaScript. Many of these projects are basic and can be found among thousands of portfolios for students learning to code. 

# Tech Used
JavaScript (of course), HTML and CSS

# Not a Portfolio
Please not that this is not a portfolio. This space is for tracking my learning journey. I have a portfolio at http://breannabang.com

# Lessons Learned
The main areas of JavaScript I wanted to practice was arrays, loops and object oriented programing. I also just wanted to practice the basic concepts and continue to commit them to memory.
