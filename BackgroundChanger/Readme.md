# About the Project
This is a Color Flipper I created using a tutorial from FreeCodeAcadamey and John Smilga. The orginal project can be found here: https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects/tree/master/01-color-flipper

# Lessons Learned
While working on this project I got to practice arrays and loops. I also got more practice using Math.Random and Math.Floor.

# How My Project Differs from the Tutorial
I went back to practice CSS and changed a few things from the original code such as centering titles and making the font bigger. I experimented with changing the text colors but went back to the originals in most cases.

For the JavaScript I changed the array in the RGB section (labeled simple on the original). I added more colors. 

# Next Steps
The hex section is able to generate colors on it's own because of the number of combinations possible and the loop. I think the RGB section should be able to as well if I change the variable from a const to a let and introduce a loop. I'll also need to update the array to show the possible RGB values.
