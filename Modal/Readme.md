# Basic JavaScript Modal 
I created this modal via the FreeCodeAcademy and John Smilga tutorial found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/

# Why this Project?
This could be useful for several website projects, such as to display additional information like terms and conditions or for newsletter sign-ups. It could also be a fun and more concise way to display additional information to keep a site looking clean.

I also wanted to practice the following JavaScript concepts:
document.querySelectorAll()
addEventListener()
Functions

# Challenges
I tried to make this an email signup with my Mailchimp embed but I couldn't figure out how to stop getting the subscribe button to open a new tab with the same email signup so I ended up making it a joke modal instead.
