# Basic JavaScript Review Carousel
I created this basic review carousel via the FreeCodeAcademy and John Smilga tutorial found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/#how-to-create-an-image-slider

# Why this Project?
<li>objects</li>
<li>DOMContentLoaded</li>
<li>addEventListener()</li>
<li>array.length</li>
<li>textContent</li>

# How My Project Differs From the Tutorial
The JavaScript for the project is the same but I updated the content to show reviews of dogs for their dog trainer. My sister is a dog trainer and I help her with her website and I plan to add a similar item to her website in the future.
